# wikipedia-search-engine
Hello! This is a Wikipedia search engine that allows users to search for Wikipedia articles directly from this interface. I've implemented a debounce function in JavaScript to optimize the search experience by delaying the generation of results until the user has stopped typing for a specified period. This helps reduce the number of API calls and improves the performance of the search functionality.
